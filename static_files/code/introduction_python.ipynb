If you do not have it installed on your laptop go over to <a href=https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>the official documentation</a> and follow the OS dependent installation guidelines.\n",
    "2. Create a labs folder for the Python labs of this course. For me, this path is `/Users/hichamjanati/Documents/work/teaching/NYU/code`. Download the notebook `introduction_python.ipynb` from the [class website](https://aiteachings.github.io/NYU-AI-Fall22/lectures/) and save it in that folder.\n",
    "3. Now we need to launch Jupyter from the labs folder. To do so, open the Anaconda Terminal (Anaconda Prompt). A command line window should pop up. If you are not familiar with line commands, for our purposes all you need to know is:\n",
